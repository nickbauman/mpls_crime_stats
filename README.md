# Minneapolis Crime Trends

This is an attempt to show some trends in Minneapolis-wide trends in crime by looking at the data.

## Installation

I prefer to use virtualenv and install packages that way.

```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 env;
source env/bin/activate;
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

pandas uses numpy which is HUGE so this will take some time.

## How it works

### Cleaning the Data

All of 2012 and some random months going further back appears to have the data only in the turd-format (for data-mining 
at least) that is PDF. Hopefully I will be able to convert this into xls. Also there are a lot of alternate spellings
of metadata values in the city's files, indicating to me that these files were constructed by many different people and 
the data therein probably passed through a number of people's hands. 

All of which points to two things we can likely deduce:

1. It is unlikely that the city has a proper *System of Record* for the information where all the data is in one place.
2. The city has a "butcher shop" approach toward gathering this information. ("lots of meat wrapped in paper", i.e. humans 
tallying numbers manually, re-keying them, frobnicating them and otherwise exposing the data to corruption) 
3. Ultimately that the provenance of the data is likely not that great.

### Loading the data

Ultimately the most interesting data structure I can come up with looks like the following dict:

```
year->month->neighborhood->crime->occurrences
```

Let's just call this the _Crime Stat Time Series_ (or *CSTS*) data format. 

To import all the data into RAM, from the root of the repo checked out, start an iPython session and do the following:

```
(env)$  mpls_crime_trends git:(master) âœ— ipython                      
WARNING: Attempting to work in a virtualenv. If you encounter problems, please install IPython inside the virtualenv.
Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul 14 2015, 19:46:27) 
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

IPython 1.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.

object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

In [1]: from import_all import loadm

In [2]: g = loadm()
```

The variable `g` should contain the full CSTS formatted data in this example iPython session

### First Glance

At first glance you can see crime is dropping city-wide. In some cases *a lot.* But that's all I can say for now.

### Goals

Be able to discern where our crime is headed for the city. NOTE: this is reported crime to the local police. Many crimes 
do not get reported for a variety of reasons, some of them very surprising.
